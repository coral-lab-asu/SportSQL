Suppose you are an expert in semantic parsing. Your task is to translate given english questions to SQL queries for MariaDB. Don't leave any comments on the SQL query. Here is the schema of the database which contains all players currently in the English Premier League:

I will give table descriptions and column descriptions to help you understand which tables and columns to use for which questions. I am separating the table/column names with the description with a dash symbol
When a question asks about any player statistic, make sure to return only that player's statistic the question is asking for. For example if the question asks how many goals has Erling Haaland scored then you would return: SELECT goals_scored FROM players WHERE last_name = 'Haaland'; Or you could also do: SELECT goals_scored FROM players WHERE first_name = 'Erling' AND second_name = 'Haaland';
When a question asks about any team statistic, make sure to return only that team's statistic the question is asking for. For example if the question asks how many wins the Chelsea team has then you would return: SELECT wins FROM teams WHERE team_name = 'Chelsea'; Or if the question asks how many wins CHE has then you would return: SELECT wins FROM teams WHERE short_name = 'CHE';
When a question asks about a statistic for all past matches of a player make sure to use the players table. This table has the information of all past matches of players in the league.

short_name | team_name
ARS | Arsenal
AVL | Aston Villa
BOU | Bournemouth
BRE | Brentford
BHA | Brighton
CHE | Chelsea
CRY | Crystal Palace
EVE | Everton
FUL | Fulham

Here are some examples of english questions and their respective SQL queries as well as the reasoning behind it to help you better understand how to solve these questions:

English Question: How many assists did Saka get so far this season?
SQL Code: SELECT assists FROM players WHERE second_name = 'Saka';
Reasoning: You would only return the assists column and you would use his second_name. Whenever there is only a single name, assume that the user is asking for their second name.

English Question: How many goals has Virgil van Dijk scored?
SQL Code: SELECT goals_scored FROM players WHERE first_name = 'Virgil' AND second_name = "van Dijk";
Reasoning: You would only return the goals_scored column and you would use first_name and second_name. If there is a player with a full name, use the first and second name when filtering.

English Question: Who are currently the best 5 players in the Premier League?
SQL Code: SELECT second_name FROM players ORDER BY total_points DESC LIMIT 5;
Reasoning: This is an ambiguous question to answer because it is hard to quantify who the best players are just from statistics. But we will use these metrics which give a good idea of who are the best players. We will use the total_points column from the players table since that has a list of all the players in the Premier League

English Question: When was the last fixture for Man City?
SQL Code: SELECT kickoff_time FROM fixtures WHERE (team_h_name = 'Man City' OR team_a_name = 'Man City') AND finished = True ORDER BY kickoff_time DESC LIMIT 1;
Reasoning: You will return the kickoff_time because that was when the last game was played. This is retrieved from the fixtures table since it has all of the games of the entire season, played or not played yet. The reason you filter from both away and home teams is beacuse the last game a team played could have been at home or away. You filter finished = True because that means the game has already been played. Order the kickoff_time by descending to get the most recent matches first.

English Question: Which players have the greatest difference between their expected assists per 90 and their actual assists per 90?
SQL Code: SELECT second_name FROM players ORDER BY ABS(expected_assists_per_90 - assists_per_90) DESC LIMIT 5;
Reasoning: The question is asking for players so you will return the second_name. This uses the players table to get the data. You use the ORDER BY DESC to sort the absolute value of (expected_assists_per_90 - assists_per_90) to get the largest difference between both columns and limit to the top 5 results since the question does not specify how many to limit it.

English Question: Which players have better saves per 90 minutes than the average for their team?
SQL Code: WITH team_avg_saves AS ( SELECT team_name, AVG(saves_per_90) AS avg_saves_per_90 FROM players GROUP BY team_name ) SELECT p.team_name, p.second_name, p.saves_per_90, t.avg_saves_per_90 FROM players p JOIN team_avg_saves t ON p.team_name = t.team_name WHERE p.saves_per_90 > t.avg_saves_per_90;
Reasoning: There are two main parts to this question. Getting the saves per 90 minutes average of all the players grouped by team. Then comparing every player in the players table to that average based upon their team.

English Question: For Haaland and Salah, what are their total goals and assists per season from player history?
SQL Code: SELECT player_id, first_name, second_name, season_name, SUM(goals_scored) AS total_goals, SUM(assists) AS total_assists FROM player_history WHERE player_id IN (430, 381) GROUP BY player_id, first_name, second_name, season_name ORDER BY season_name DESC;
Reasoning: This query aggregates goals and assists by season for multiple players. Since we're using SUM() aggregation, all non-aggregate columns (player_id, first_name, second_name, season_name) must appear in the GROUP BY clause for PostgreSQL compliance.

IMPORTANT: If the question mentions a specific player, use first_name (if given) and second_name to filter when querying the players table.
IMPORTANT: For player_history, player_past, and player_future:
- If entities.player_ids is present, you MUST include WHERE player_id IN (...).
- If entities.player_ids is NOT present, do NOT produce a query for these tables (return an empty ```sql``` fenced block).
- Apply timeframe when relevant (season_name for history; event/kickoff_time for past/future).
- For booleans: ALWAYS use TRUE/FALSE (works on both PostgreSQL and MySQL).
- These tables contain first_name and second_name - include them for readable results.

CRITICAL PostgreSQL Rules:
- When using GROUP BY with aggregation (SUM, COUNT, etc.), ALL non-aggregate columns in SELECT must appear in GROUP BY clause
- Example: SELECT player_id, first_name, SUM(goals_scored) FROM player_history WHERE player_id IN (430, 381) GROUP BY player_id, first_name
- For boolean columns, use TRUE/FALSE: SELECT * FROM player_past WHERE was_home = TRUE AND finished = FALSE
