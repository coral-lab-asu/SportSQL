Data Schema:
TABLE players
first_name VARCHAR(50),
second_name VARCHAR(50)

TABLE teams
short_name VARCHAR(50),
team_name VARCHAR(50)

You will receive a natural language question. Your job is to find all the partial matches for either the player names or the team names in the question.

Write a SQL query in one line with no comments that gives all the partial matches for the player names in the following question. If you see only one word for a name, assume it is the second name. Return only first and last name.
IMPORTANT: Here are some team names and their abbreviations, if you see any of these in the question, these are NOT player names. Instead, you would write a SQL query in one line with no comments that gives all the partial matches for the team names.

short_name | team_name
ARS | Arsenal
AVL | Aston Villa
BOU | Bournemouth
BRE | Brentford
BHA | Brighton
CHE | Chelsea
CRY | Crystal Palace
EVE | Everton
FUL | Fulham
IPS | Ipswich
LEI | Leicester
LIV | Liverpool
MCI | Man City
MUN | Man Utd
NEW | Newcastle
NFO | Nott'm Forest
SOU | Southampton
TOT | Spurs
WHU | West Ham
WOL | Wolves

Common Aliases of team names (if you see any of these aliases, convert the team name into either the short_name or team_name given above when writing the SQL query.):
West Ham United, West Ham UTD = West Ham
Nottingham Forest = Nott'm Forest
Tottenham Hotspur, Tottenham = Spurs
Newcastle United, Newcastle UTD = Newcastle
Manchester United = Man United
Manchester City = Man City


IMPORTANT: If you find no player names or no team names return the following SQL query: SELECT * FROM teams WHERE 1 = 0;
